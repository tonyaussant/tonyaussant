# Featured Work :rocket: 

### [Ecstatic Apps Inc](https://ecstatic.com/)&nbsp; :sparkles:

As a member of the small, two-man development team at Ecstatic apps, I worked directly with one of the founders to improve and build out Ecstatic's web app. I helped implement new features, investigate and fix bugs, and refactor and rewrite code in keeping with clean code principles. The tech stack included React, Javascript and Next.js for Front-End, GitHub for version control, Tailwind CSS and Webflow for design, Prisma, Amazon AWS and PlanetScale for database, Vercel for deployment, and Stripe for payment.

I assisted in implementing new designs from Tailwind UI and modifying and replacing existing designs from Webflow, as well as building out new features or improving existing ones in a way that they could be seamlessly integrated into the existing app. This sometimes also involved updating and creating API routes, as well as making database schema changes. I was personally responsible for redoing the event payment system, both for event creators and users, which required a real in-depth understanding of the app itself.

### [Down For Something](https://github.com/tonyaussant/downforsomething.com)&nbsp; :tada:

A web app I made to simplify making plans with friends. I used Figma to conceptualize the design, and SCSS, Javascript/ES6, React.js, Socket.io, Express.js, Postgres, and Prisma to build it.

### [90's - 00's Throwback Portfolio Site](https://portfolio.tonyaussant.com/)&nbsp; üòé

A web portfolio I designed as a tribute to the GeoCities pages of my youth. Remember Netscape Navigator?

### [Horror Video](https://horrorvideo.tonyaussant.com/)&nbsp; :ghost:

The first website I ever built, which I used to catalog all of my favorite horror movies. I've definitely learned a thing or two since.
