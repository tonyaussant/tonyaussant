# Projects :rocket: 

### [Down For Something](https://github.com/tonyaussant/downforsomething.com)&nbsp; :tada:

A web app I made to simplify making plans with friends. I used Figma to conceptualize the design, and SCSS, Javascript/ES6, React.js, Socket.io, Express.js, Postgres, and Prisma to build it.

### [90's - 00's Throwback Portfolio Site](https://portfolio.tonyaussant.com/)&nbsp; üòé

A web portfolio I designed as a tribute to the GeoCities pages of my youth. Remember Netscape Navigator?

### [Horror Video](https://horrorvideo.tonyaussant.com/)&nbsp; :ghost:

The first website I ever built, which I used to catalog all of my favorite horror movies. I've definitely learned a thing or two since.
